# LocalizationTutorial

This is a simple Unreal 4.27 project, which provides various examples of setting up, using and handling localization via Unreal's build-in system.

## Why?
You may wonder why to create another tutorial for Unreal's localization system, when there's plenty of them around the Internet? The reason is simple - I've just wanted to have a reference for myself how to use this system in case I forgot about all I've learned in the recent months. I hope it will help me - and help you too! - in understanding how to setup localization quickly and less painfully.
