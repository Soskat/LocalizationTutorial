# Localization Tutorial

Welcome at the Localization Tutorial repository, where you can find an Unreal example project that provides various examples of setting up, using and handling localization via Unreal localization system. Along the source code you have access to the project wiki, where all concepts and examples have been described and explained.

The current examples project has been build in Unreal Engine 5.1 version, however all processes and localization pipelines are the same as in the 4.27 engine version.

## Why?
You may wonder why to create another tutorial for Unreal's localization system, when there's plenty of them around the Internet? The reason is simple - I've just wanted to have a reference for myself how to use this system in case I forgot about all I've learned in the recent months. I hope it will help me - and help you too! - in understanding how to setup localization quickly and less painfully.

## Installation and usage
This repository contains a condensated project, that desn't need any dependencies other than Unreal engine. Simply download it and run .uproject file.
